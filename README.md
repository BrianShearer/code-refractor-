# code-refractor-

This readme file documents a bootcamp challenge. The challenge involved refactoring code for a web page that intels the critera listed below. 

Acceptable Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


The following is the  user story given for the background reason for the refactory.

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

 I reorganized the head element to flow better with a title of the company name. 
 I went through the HTML code to rename divisions with more descriptive code. 
 I added alt attributes to the images.
